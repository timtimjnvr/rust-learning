- profiles for dev & release can be configured in the `Cargo.toml` (it includes compiling optimization level, etc ...)
- documentation can be generated using `cargo doc` (the generated doc goes into `target/doc` directory).
- some sections advised to be documented :
    - Panics
    - Errors
    - Safety
- `///`: for item documentation
- `//!`: to document the parent item
- re exporting items at the root of you module is a good practice to make a public API clear.
- `cargo yank --vers <version>` deprecates a version for new usage (does not prevent exiqting users that have a `Cargo.lock`)
- **workspace** is a set of packages that share the same `Cargo.lock` and output directory (this ensure that the workspaces package will share the same versions for same dependencies).
- each crate in a workspace need to be published separately on crate.io.
